In this branch I put the explanation and complexity of the operations of the structures in each folder to have a better order and to make the repo more clear.

# History and Motivation

I created this project when I was in my first year of college to understand the background and how data structures really work, because I think that to really learn new things we should know how they work behind scenes and not just memorize the code.

So 1 year later I decided to create this repository, beacuse I think this project can help people, like it helped me, to understand the implementation of many Data Structures, and improve their understanding when using Data Structures.

# Contribution/Comments

I know there are many ways of implementation and surely there are better than mine, but as I said, I created this project when I was in the first year of my college and I tried make it as good as possible; so if you found a bug, a way to improve or want to contribute, feel free to comment or pull request.

All the data structures where implemented in C++; for a better order, a folder was given to each structure, which has 3 files each one: 
- The library: that has all the implementation
- An example code: that has an example of how to use the structure. U can use it as a guide to create your own program using that structure.
- Readme file: Has a short explanation about the data structure and the complexity of its operations. 

In order to understand the implementation you have to study the library file and then read the complexity table, which is below.

If you want to use a structure just download the library and in the same folder create a cpp code including that library **(#include "structure.h")**, use the cpp files as a guide.

In some data structures I added some functions/methods that arent used in a normal program, just in an specific program; but I added just to see how they can be implemented.
